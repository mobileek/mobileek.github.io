 it's like a normal phone. but in a watch form
it has call recorder?﻿
Rechargeable﻿
It doesn't have a headphone jack, but you can pair a bluetooth headset to it.
micro sim ?? can you use the one out of your phone﻿
Can you send sms text messages!? Can you reply to text!? Can you set up quick responses for texts!?﻿

I bought this for work so I don't have to keep pulling my phone out my pocket. I only need the bluetooth notifications feature, texting and some time answer or make calls (through my phone). The other features I can really do without﻿

I was hoping you'd show if it can reply and send texts , and show how! 

Liten to music via loudspeaker on the watch or thru bluetooth headset.

Can you put a text in notepad? Cheating on tests and stuff like that.﻿
