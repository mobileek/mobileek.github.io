How-To Recover Your Surface RT
Requirements:
1) An extra computer
2) A USB with any storage greater than 3 GB


STEPS:
1) Plug in your USB & go to softpedia.com/get/System/Back-Up-and-Recovery/Surface-RT-Recovery-Image.shtml (It is a safe download, I used it myself to downgrade)
2) Extract it to your USB (If your USB has anything in it, you have to remove those files)
3) Wait for it to finish extracting
4) Unplug the USB
5) Plug it into your Surface
6) Hold down Power + Volume Down until you see the Surface splash screen
7) Wait for it to load, then select your language and your keyboard type
8) If it asks for a "BitLocker Passcode", a copy of it is saved on your Microsoft Account.
9) Click on 'Advanced Options' (?).
10) Click on 'Reset'
11) Wait until it is done wiping the computer, and then...
12) Configure your device (customize, connect to a network, etc...)
13) DO WHATERVER YOU WANT WITH IT!!!
14) Thank me if it works (PLZ)
Hope it worked!
