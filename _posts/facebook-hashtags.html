"I spent a lot of time working on technologies that I’d hoped would unify the social web and give people more choice – and instead of any of those efforts taking off, this stupid, stupid idea I had ending up being the thing that caught fire. Go figure."

  Facebook was quite late to boarding the Hashtag bandwagon. It took Facebook 6 years to announce support of hashtag. In June 2013, facebook published an article on its online newsroom page http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2013/06/public-conversations-on-facebook/

<blockquote>
"hashtags on Facebook allow you to add context to a post or indicate that it is part of a larger discussion. When you click on a hashtag in Facebook, you’ll see a feed of what other people and Pages are saying about that event or topic."
"Hashtags are just the first step to help people more easily discover what others are saying about a specific topic and participate in public conversations."
